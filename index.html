            <h3>Face Data / Photos</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>In Short:</strong> We collect face data solely to extract skin tone color. Photos are processed immediately and permanently deleted within seconds. Face data is never stored, never shared with third parties, and never retained.
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>What face data does the app collect?</strong> When you take a photo in the Glowbase app, we temporarily process the image to extract only your skin tone color (hexadecimal value).</p>
            
            <p><strong>How is face data used?</strong> Face data is used exclusively to analyze skin tone color. No facial recognition, identification, or biometric analysis is performed. The photo is processed once to generate a non-identifiable color value.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Face data storage and retention:</strong> Face data is <strong>never stored or retained</strong>. Photos are processed on our secure servers and permanently deleted within seconds of processing. We do not create backups, copies, or retain face data in any form.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Third-party sharing:</strong> Face data is <strong>never shared with third parties</strong>. We do not send photos or face data to AI providers, analytics services, or any external parties. Only the derived, non-identifiable skin tone value (not the photo) may be shared with our AI service provider to generate personalized recommendations.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Third-party storage practices:</strong> Since we never share face data with third parties, no third-party services store, retain, or process your face data. Our AI providers receive only the extracted color value, not the original photo or any face data.</p>
